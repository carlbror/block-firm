# block-firm
A simple joint stock company for Ethereum

This is built on [TokenERC20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard), but exchanging shares instead of tokens. Also, there are no approve-related functions.

It has only a few functions. The president of the company can publish annual reports and appoint accountants. The accountant for the annual report can verify it, or not, and every accountant can publish problems with the management of the company.

As of yet, the president can not be elected by the shareholders.

There is a setup and tutorial on how to use the contract at [Stocks and Bucket](https://stocksandbucket.com/company-interface).
